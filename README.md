# AI Callback

**AI Callback** is a lightweight, framework-agnostic Python library that **post-processes** responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) using **modular condition–action callbacks**. This design enables developers to easily:

- **Append disclaimers** for financial, medical, or legal advice  
- **Redact abusive or hateful language**  
- **Enrich outputs** with real-time data (e.g., weather)  
- **Track time** from request to response  
- Detect **incomplete** or **inaccurate** responses and automatically re-prompt  

---

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Works with **OpenAI**, **Hugging Face**, or any custom LLM.  
- **Modular**: Add or remove condition–action pairs with minimal refactoring.  
- **Extensible**: Create new rules for compliance checks, brand guidelines, disclaimers, or specialized tasks.  
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and pure Python.  
- **Framework-Agnostic**: Doesn’t lock you into a single approach (like chain-of-thought or agent-based solutions).

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jinoyravindran/ai-callback.git
cd ai-callback

2. Install dependencies

It’s recommended to use a virtual environment or conda environment to avoid polluting system-wide packages:

# Create and activate a virtual environment (example using venv)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

(On Windows, activate via venv\Scripts\activate.)

This installs dependencies like transformers, requests, openai, etc.

Basic Usage

The core library is in the ai_callback/ folder:
	•	callback.py: Defines the AICallback manager.
	•	conditions.py: Example condition functions (detecting abuse, disclaimers, incomplete responses, etc.).
	•	actions.py: Example action functions (redacting text, adding disclaimers, calling weather APIs, etc.).
	•	time_tracking.py: Simple utility to measure elapsed time from LLM request to final callback.

Workflow:
	1.	Create an instance of AICallback.
	2.	Add (condition, action) pairs.
	3.	Generate an LLM response, then call callback.process(response) to get the modified output.

Examples

We provide two main usage scripts:

Hugging Face (usage_hf.py)
	•	Generates text using GPT-2 (for a demo).
	•	Registers disclaimers, abusive language redaction, weather enrichment, incomplete response handling, and optional time tracking or toxicity detection.

To run:

cd ai_callback
python usage_hf.py

You’ll see the Raw Output from GPT-2 vs. the Processed Output after callbacks.

OpenAI (usage_openai.py)
	•	Similar approach but uses openai.Completion.create (or openai.ChatCompletion.create).
	•	Requires your OpenAI API key.

To run:
	1.	Export or set your OpenAI API key:

export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."


	2.	Then:

cd ai_callback
python usage_openai.py


	3.	The script prints the LLM’s raw response and the final output after callbacks.

Testing in a Fresh VM

For reviewers or anyone wanting a clean environment (e.g., an AWS EC2 instance):
	1.	Create VM (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended).
	2.	Install basic packages:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip git


	3.	Clone & Install:

git clone https://github.com/jinoyravindran/ai-callback.git
cd ai-callback
pip3 install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Run usage_hf.py:

cd ai_callback
python3 usage_hf.py


	5.	(Optional) For OpenAI, set OPENAI_API_KEY and run:

python3 usage_openai.py



This ensures a reproducible setup for testing.

Developing & Contributing
	1.	Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
	2.	Add new conditions/actions in conditions.py and actions.py.
	3.	Test by running the usage scripts.
	4.	Submit a Pull Request for review.

Open issues for any questions or suggestions.
